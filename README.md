The following links have been curated from sites I've used for years to get better at using the skills necessary to create some interesting generative ideas.

## Learning Resources 

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Youtube 
* [The Code Train]() 
This is a great site on learning how to step through a problem and translate it to code.
=======
### Code Repositories
The following repositories are in my opinion the best place to start learning how to create generative art. Once you have used a programming language and understand the concept of the logic flow within a program; the best way to really understand code is to read it. Here are some influential ones: 

* [Nature of Code Repo](https://github.com/nature-of-code/noc-book)

* [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman/LearningProcessing) - 
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

### Data Visualization 
* [Information Is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) 

### Interesting Projects 

### Inspirational Sites
* [Creative Applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/)

The following portfolio is a bit outdated however was one of the first important sites to be used. 


## Communities
The following groups are not entirely processing only; however there is much 
### Reddit 
* [Generative Art](https://reddit.com/r/generativeart) 
* [Procedural Generation(https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/)
### Discourse
* [Official Processing Community](https://discourse.processing.org)

Though this isn't the pure implementation of the Java based processing kernel; it provides enough code that can be ported and then used for the many different use cases.
