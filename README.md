The following links have been curated from sites I've used for years to get better at using the skills necessary to create some interesting generative ideas.  

## Learning Resources 

### Youtube 
* [The Code Train]() 
This is a great site on learning how to step through a problem and translate it to code.

### Data Visualization 
* [Information Is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) 

### Interesting Projects 

### Inspirational Sites
* [Creative Applications](http://www.creativeapplications.net/)
* [Ben Fry](http://www.benfry.com/projects)
The following portfolio is a bit outdated however was one of the first important sites to be used. 


## Communities
The following groups are not entirely processing only; however there is much 
### Reddit 
* [Generative Art](https://reddit.com/r/generativeart) 

### Discourse
* [Official Processing Community](https://discourse.processing.org)

### Books 
* [Processing: A Programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists](https://amzn.to/2lqFgGz)
* [Generative Design: Visualize, Program and Create with Javascript in p5.js](https://amzn.to/2lt3z6M) 
* [Generative Art: A Practicle Guide Using Processing](https://amzn.to/2mhaIqY)

Though this isn't the pure implementation of the Java based processing kernel; it provides enough code that can be ported and then used for the many different use cases.
